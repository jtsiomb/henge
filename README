Henge 3D engine
Author: John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org>
License: GNU LGPL v3 (or any later version), see COPYING and COPYING.LESSER.

Installation
------------
To compile and install (default prefix is /usr/local) just go into the henge
directory and type:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Usage
-----
To use henge in your projects make sure you pass the output of
"pkg-config --cflags henge2" to the compiler, and the output of
"pkg-config --libs henge2" to the linker.

There's no documentation at the moment, try to figure out how to use henge by
looking through the header files, and the example programs in the tests
subdirectory.
